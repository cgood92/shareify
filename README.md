# Shareify

This is a project for me to learn/experiment with React.js.  It's not meant to be perfect, or even good - just a learning playground.  I'm using Firebase as database (which I'm also new to), and hosting using Firebase.

### Local Setup

    npm install
    gulp serve

Note: The purpose of the live app above is to demo what I've learned about React.js.  Please be nice in playing around, and don't take advantage of any security holes that would be easy to find.
