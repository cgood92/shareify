# Shareify

This is a project for me to learn/experiment with React.js.  It's not meant to be perfect, or even good - just a learning playground.  I'm using Firebase as database (which I'm also new to), and hosting using Firebase.

### Local Setup

    npm install
    gulp #This will build/serve/watch/reload
